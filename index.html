        <h2>Short biography</h2>

        <p>My name is Ben Halliwell. I was born in Waterville, Maine and after leaving Maine for military service, I
            currently live in Dresden, Maine. My wife is a small business owner, a flower farmer, and is in her first
            commercial season.</p>

        <p>In between finishing my work as a financial planner and starting at Code Fellows, I decided to change course and pursue 
            a career in environmental protection and biodiversity. My goal is to offer everyone the opportunity to see the value of 
            biological diversity and the extent of biodiversity loss in the last 100 years. I don't believe that reports and statistics 
            will effectively illustrate to the public where we are at this time. I believe that technology has a huge part to play in 
            allowing each of us to experience the natural world how it *could* be and compare that to how it currently is.</p>

        <br>
        <p>This goal led me to software development. I want to develop a program that allows anyone, anywhere to see with
            their own eyes how far we have come in an extremely short period of time. It is my goal to use a combination of
            photogrammetry and volumetric video to make this a reality and to initially deploy the service to historically 
            significant locations, National Parks, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and UNESCO World Heritage sites.</p>
